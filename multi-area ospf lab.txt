# Multi-area OSPF lab

## Topology
- R1 <==> R2: Area 0 (10.1.1.0/30)
- R2 <==> R3: Area 1 (10.1.1.4/30)
- R2 == ABR
- PC1 <==> R1: 192.168.10.100/24, GW 192.168.10.1
- PC2 <==> R2: 192.168.20.100/24, GW 192.168.20.1

## Objectives
- Basic simulation of multi-area OSPF
- Verify reachability between Area 0 and Area 1
- Observe LSA propagation

## Notes
- Used Packet Tracer for this build
- Initially assigned the IP address 10.1.1.5 on R2 to the wrong interface. Fixed.
- It works.
